### **Parameter Estimation for a Parametric Curve**

---

## Objective

The objective of this project is to estimate the unknown parameters **θ (theta)**, **M**, and **X** in a nonlinear **parametric curve model**.
We are provided with a dataset of points ((x_i, y_i)) that approximately follow this curve.
Our goal is to find parameter values that minimize the difference between the theoretical model and the given data, using mathematical optimization.

---

## Mathematical Model

The model describing the curve is given by the following parametric equations:

x(t) = t*cos(theta) - e^(M|t|)*sin(0.3t)*sin(theta) + X  
y(t) = 42 + t*sin(theta) + e^(M|t|)*sin(0.3t)*cos(theta)

where t ∈ [6, 60].

Here:  
* theta controls the **rotation** of the curve,
* M introduces **exponential scaling or damping**, and
* X is the **horizontal translation** parameter.

The dataset contains observed coordinates ((x_i, y_i)) for different (unknown) (t_i).
Since (t_i) values are not explicitly given, we assume they are **uniformly spaced** within the given range.

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading**
   The dataset (`xy_data.csv`) was loaded using Pandas, and the x, y values were extracted into NumPy arrays.
   A uniform sequence of ( t ) values was generated between 6 and 60, matching the number of data points.

2. **Model Definition**
   The above equations for (x(t)) and (y(t)) were implemented as a Python function.
   For any chosen ((\theta, M, X)), the function predicts the curve coordinates.

3. **Optimization Formulation**
   To find the best-fit parameters, we define a **loss function** measuring the total difference between predicted and actual points:

L(theta, M, X) = Σ ( |x_i - x(t_i; theta, M, X)| + |y_i - y(t_i; theta, M, X)| )

This is an **L1 loss** (sum of absolute errors), chosen for robustness against small data fluctuations.

4. **Optimization Process**
   The optimization problem is expressed as:

(theta*, M*, X*) = argmin L(theta, M, X)

Subject to:  
0° < theta < 50°  
-0.05 < M < 0.05  
0 < X < 100

The **L-BFGS-B** algorithm from SciPy was used since it supports bounded nonlinear optimization efficiently.

5. **Visualization**
   After optimization, the predicted curve ((x(t), y(t))) was plotted along with the actual data points using **Matplotlib** for validation.

## Results

The optimization converged successfully, yielding the following parameter estimates:

| Parameter          | Symbol     | Estimated Value |
| ------------------ | ---------- | --------------- |
| Rotation Angle     | ( \theta ) | 28.1184°        |
| Exponential Factor | ( M )      | 0.021389        |
| Translation        | ( X )      | 54.9009         |

### 🔹 Final Fitted Equations

x(t) = t*cos(0.491) - e^(0.021389*|t|)*sin(0.3t)*sin(0.491) + 54.9009  
y(t) = 42 + t*sin(0.491) + e^(0.021389*|t|)*sin(0.3t)*cos(0.491)

*(where 0.491 radians ≈ 28.1184°)*

## Visualization

The plot below shows the original dataset (blue points) and the fitted curve (orange line).
The close overlap confirms that the optimized parameters accurately describe the curve’s structure.

## Mathematical Discussion

The fitted model minimizes the **distance in the parametric space** between observed and predicted data.
The parameter theta primarily affects the slope and rotation of the curve, while M controls how sharply the curve bends due to the exponential term e^M|t|.
The translation X aligns the curve horizontally with the data.

By iteratively adjusting these parameters, the optimizer finds the minimum of the loss function L(theta, M, X), which represents the most accurate alignment between theoretical and empirical data.

The resulting equation acts as a compact mathematical model that describes the underlying geometric behavior of the dataset.

## Conclusion

This assignment demonstrates how **mathematical modeling and optimization** can be combined to estimate unknown parameters in a nonlinear system.
Through the use of **L-BFGS-B optimization** and an **L₁ loss function**, accurate estimates for θ, M, and X were obtained, producing a close match between predicted and observed data.

This approach is commonly used in **AI model calibration, 3D reconstruction, and system identification** — all of which are relevant to FLAM’s focus on spatial computing and AI-driven simulation.
